## Installing Conda + Jupyter

Conda is a package/library manager for Python. Jupyter is an interactive python environment.

Here are the installation instructions:

Easy version:

1. Install Anaconda using the instructions [here](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html#regular-installation).
Ignore the "silent mode" instructions. Make sure to test your installation.

2. Launch Jupyter. (If my instructions are not clear, try these [ones](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html)

    a. On Windows find the `Jupyter Notebook` application and launch it. Navigate to this repository
    b. On Mac/Unix open a terminal and navigate to this repository, then type `jupyter notebook`.
    
3. A browser window should open. Open the `movie_sentiment/Movie Review Notebook.ipynb` file.
